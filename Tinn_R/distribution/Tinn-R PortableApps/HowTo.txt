::	Description: That's a document to help anyone who wants to know how to 
	generate a Tinn-R release package for PortableApps platform.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::  First of all, open the structure folder located in the same folder
	you found that "how-to" file, there you'll find a bash script called
	"structure.bat", run it. That script will create a new folder "Tinn-RPortable" 
	inside bin, there are all files needed to generate .paf file.
	
**  .paf is the extension related to PortableApps platform.
	
::  To generate .paf files, download and install PortableApps Installer.

**  To download PortableApps Installer, go to: 
	http://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_installer
	
::	If you want to change release's version, open "appinfo.ini" located in
	Tinn-RPortable\source\appinfo and change the PackageVersion and DisplayVersion
	to the one you're releasing (following the patch).
	
:: 	Then, open PortableApps Installer, when it asks for a patch, inform where 
	your Tinn-RPortable folder (that one you generate by structure script)
	is located. For example:
	
	GitHub\Tinn-R\Tinn_R\distribution\Tinn-R PortableApps\bin\Tinn-RPortable
	
	So, press "Go>", wait until the end, and click "Finish". Now you have your ".paf"
	ready for integrate the PortableApps platform. 
	
:: 	Delete the generated folder "Tinn-R Portable" after procedure.
